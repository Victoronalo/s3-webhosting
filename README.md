# s3-webhosting



Objective:
I am to create an S3 bucket, uploading a static website, configuring the bucket for static website hosting and testing the hosted website.


-I started by logging into my AWS management console.



-I navigated to the S3 on the AWS management console.


-I created an S3 bucket named “s3-staticwebhosting”.


-I proceeded to get a website.


-I then uploaded the website to the S3 bucket.


-But at this point I tried running the web and it was giving error message.


-I proceeded to the permission module on the bucket and made the website accessible by unchecking the block public access box.


-It still gave error message while trying to run the website.


-I proceeded to the ACL policy and changed it.


-At this time the website is fully functional when run.


-In the course of doing this project I came across some huddles but with the help of the team and the internet it was successful.


-Also it is worth noting that a lot was learnt in the course of this project.
